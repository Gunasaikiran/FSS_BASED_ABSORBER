# FSS Based Absorber
This Project presents a novel design for a 3-D printed conformal absorber
based on frequency selective surface (FSS) concept, which exhibits excellent
broadband performance and flexibility. The absorber incorporates an innovative
design element printed on a PLA dielectric, supported by a perforated substrate and
an air gap, that makes it lightweight while maintaining high absorptivity. Resistive
ink is used to print the design pattern on the PLA substrate and a comprehensive
parametric analysis is carried out through simulation to meticulously evaluate each
design parameterâ€™s impact. The geometry demonstrates a remarkable absorption
bandwidth covering frequencies from 8.5 GHz to 29.2 GHz (having a fractional
bandwidth of 109.81%), with absorption levels consistently exceeding 90%. The
design offers broad coverage, spanning the X, Ku, and K bands, and exhibits
polarization insensitivity, ensuring effectiveness across various incident wave
polarizations. Additionally, the absorber remains stable under oblique incidence for
both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes up to 45 degrees
of incident angle, making it ideal for a range of practical applications that require
conformal and flexible electromagnetic absorption. An equivalent circuit model is
created as well as surface current distributions are studied to understand the
mechanism of the proposed absorber in detail. Finally, the absorber has been
fabricated using a low-cost 3-D printing technology and the measured results has
been demonstrated that aligns well with the simulated ones. <br>
